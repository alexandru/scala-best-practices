## 0. Preface

What follows is a list of best practices I compiled for my colleagues,
advice sprung from the painful experience coming naturally from
dealing with other people's code :-)

Defining a list of best practices is always hard. I like to think that
we are defining a protocol of communication, because we are. Therefore
this document uses keywords defined in
[RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt), to differentiate
between rules that should never be broken and those that can be broken
if you know what you're doing.

This list is also far from complete.

### 0.1. MUST NOT follow advice blindly

This should be the first rule of any document that describes best
practices.

Always try to understand the reasons behind a rule, don't
cargo-cult. Following advice blindly leads to the worst hairballs
imaginable.
